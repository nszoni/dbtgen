    description: The dim_customers model is a tool that provides a comprehensive view
      of customer behavior. It tracks key details such as the total value a customer
      has brought (customer_lifetime_value), the date of their first and most recent
      orders, and the total number of orders they've made. This information can be
      used to identify loyal customers, understand purchasing patterns, and develop
      targeted marketing strategies. For example, customers with high lifetime values
      and frequent orders may be ideal targets for loyalty programs.
